# Comparing Multivariate Analytical Approaches to Investigating Brain Behavior Relationships

We used partial least squares canonical (PLSC), canonical correlation analysis and partial least squares regression (PLSR) to evaluate a relationship between two rich variable sets. A first variable set X was constructed from the cortical and subcortical gray matter volume. A parallel variable set Y was constructed from the psychopathology data for 4 psychopathology factors. Each method produces 4 components and each component is tested for their  statistical significance based on our permutation testing framework. 

We have also included a section of the script to construct a heat map of output loading strengths.

main.py constructs the variable sets and runs the analyses for each of the three methods.

The following external libraries are necessary: sklearn, numpy, scipy, nilearn, seaborn
